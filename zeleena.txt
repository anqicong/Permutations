clicked recursive case after def line
can't unclick recursive case
looks like the answer space, depth could be more clear
don't ask recursive or base right away
go through if statement and then skips to else
"recursive case" and "base case"
label the final output, make it clear that you're not done at the base case
why are all the lines highlighted
underscores instead of boxes for the loop part, or a different color
add commas in loop part
we need stages and to enforce people click on something
red check interesting...visual difference necessary at all??
be able to uncheck things and submit when you click next?
need display that it's ended
yellow fading alert instead of final feedback for practice mode for wrong base and recursive
not sure what the key insight, what are we for looping through?
instructions for this: make allPerms for one iteration of the loop
thought 79 goes in one place
red arrow? only practice mode
COMMAS
connection between previous return value and the old frame
label the number depth on the code highlight
go through the if statement!!
maybe use 3 elements and not 2 to show the idea more clearly
highlight different color because green/red convey correctness
label the number to insert as a[0]
ensure the numbers to permute aren't the same LOL
write allPerms
use the empty space on the left? each depth's allPerms, perhaps could help in quiz mode (but is it overkill?)
font needs to be bigger
